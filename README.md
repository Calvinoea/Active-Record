# Active-Record
BUILDING WITH ACTIVE RECORD [Project by Microverse] (Created by Sayyod Saidov and Calvin Ebun-Amu)


# What it does

The project requires us to build data structures necessary to support link submissions and commenting of a forum application like Reddit which makes it possible for a user to create a post and add comments to it. With the program, one can use the Rails console to manipulate models. We had to use our understanding of active record, models, and associations to complete the project.
